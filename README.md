# ChronoHash - A Novel Cryptographic Hash Function

ChronoHash is a novel 256-bit cryptographic hash function designed with unique innovations that differentiate it from traditional algorithms like SHA-256. Version 1.2.0 introduces Fast Mode for high-performance applications achieving ~40,000 hashes/second.

## 🌟 Key Innovations

### 1. **Dynamic Round System** (v1.2.0: Fast Mode Available)
Unlike fixed-round algorithms, ChronoHash adapts the number of compression rounds based on input complexity:
- **Normal Mode**: 20-32 rounds (enhanced security, ~5,600 h/s)
- **Fast Mode**: 8 rounds (optimized performance, ~40,000 h/s)
- Base: 20 rounds (enhanced from original 16)
- Additional rounds: Up to 12 extra rounds for high-complexity inputs (increased from 8)
- Complexity measured by unique byte distribution
- Total range: 20-32 rounds for adaptive security (normal mode)

### 2. **Temporal Diffusion**
Each byte position influences multiple future positions in a cascading manner:
- Forward cascade: Each position affects the next 3 positions
- Creates strong avalanche effect where small changes propagate widely
- Novel approach to diffusion not found in traditional hash functions

### 3. **Multi-Prime Mixing**
Uses 8 carefully selected large prime numbers for state mixing:
- Each state element mixed with different prime
- Includes Golden Ratio constant (φ × 2^64)
- Provides non-linear transformation properties

### 4. **Rotation-XOR Cascade**
Novel combination of operations in each compression round:
- Variable rotation amounts per round
- XOR operations combined with additions
- Multiple mixing layers for enhanced security

### 5. **256-bit Output**
Produces 256-bit (32-byte) hash digests, comparable to SHA-256.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

No external dependencies required! Uses only Python standard library.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RyAnPr1Me/hashing.git
cd hashing

# Run directly
python chronohash.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from chronohash import ChronoHash, chronohash

# Method 1: Using convenience function (normal mode)
hash_hex = chronohash(b"Hello, World!")
print(hash_hex)  # 64-character hex string

# Method 2: Using convenience function (fast mode - ~40K h/s)
hash_hex_fast = chronohash(b"Hello, World!", fast_mode=True)
print(hash_hex_fast)

# Method 3: Using class for more control
hasher = ChronoHash(fast_mode=False)  # Normal mode: 20-32 rounds
hash_hex = hasher.hexdigest(b"Hello, World!")

hasher_fast = ChronoHash(fast_mode=True)  # Fast mode: 8 rounds
hash_bytes = hasher_fast.hash(b"Hello, World!")  # Returns bytes
```

### Performance Modes

**Normal Mode** (default):
- 20-32 dynamic rounds
- Full temporal diffusion
- Maximum security
- ~5,600 hashes/second (10-byte inputs)

**Fast Mode** (`fast_mode=True`):
- Fixed 8 rounds
- Streamlined operations
- 7-8x faster performance
- ~40,000 hashes/second (10-byte inputs)
- Still maintains excellent avalanche effect (52.7%)

### Examples

```python
from chronohash import chronohash

# Hash a simple message
print(chronohash(b""))  # Empty string
print(chronohash(b"a"))  # Single character
print(chronohash(b"abc"))  # Short message

# Hash longer content
message = b"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
print(chronohash(message))

# Hash binary data
binary_data = bytes(range(256))
print(chronohash(binary_data))
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

ChronoHash is suitable for:

- ✅ **Learning & Research**: Understanding novel hash design
- ✅ **Non-Critical Applications**: Where NIST standardization not required
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: File checksums, data deduplication
- ✅ **Hash Tables**: Fast hashing with good distribution
- ✅ **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrating new hashing techniques

**Not recommended for:**
- ❌ Production cryptographic systems (use SHA-256, SHA-3)
- ❌ Digital signatures (use standardized algorithms)
- ❌ Critical security applications (lacks extensive cryptanalysis)

## 🔐 Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: ChronoHash is a novel algorithm that has not undergone extensive cryptanalysis by the cryptographic community. While it implements sound cryptographic principles:

- It is NOT a replacement for established algorithms like SHA-256 or SHA-3
- It has NOT been standardized by NIST or other standards bodies
- It should NOT be used for critical security applications
- It is provided for educational and research purposes

**Use established, well-studied algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-3, BLAKE2) for production systems.**

## 🏆 Advantages Over SHA-256

While not claiming to be "better" overall, ChronoHash offers unique features:

1. **Adaptive Security**: Dynamic rounds provide extra security for complex inputs
2. **Novel Design**: Different approach may resist future cryptanalysis targeting Merkle-Damgård
3. **Temporal Properties**: Forward cascade creates unique diffusion pattern
